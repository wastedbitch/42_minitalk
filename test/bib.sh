5  Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek 

6 Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic

development has become the most vicious animal of all

emotional gratification 

9 Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had as he has kept it in business all

THE BOOK OF SATAN I 

1  In this arid wilderness of steel and stone I raise up my voice that you may hear To the 
East and to the West I beckon To the North and to the South I show a sign 
proclaiming Death to the weakling wealth to the strong 

2 Open your eyes that you may see Oh men of mildewed minds and listen to me ye 
bewildered millions 

3 For I stand forth to challenge the wisdom of the world to interrogate the laws of 
man and of God 

4 I request reason for your golden rule and ask the why and wherefore of your ten 
commandments 

5 Before none of your printed idols do I bend in acquiescence and he who saith thou 
shalt to me is my mortal foe 

6 I dip my forefinger in the watery blood of your impotent mad redeemer and write 
over his thorn torn brow The true prince of evil  the king of slaves 

7 No hoary falsehood shall be a truth to me no stifling dogma shall encramp my pen 

8 I break away from all conventions that do not lead to my earthly success and 
happiness 

9 I raise up in stem invasion the standard of the strong 

10 1 gaze into the glassy eye of your fearsome Jehovah and pluck him by the beard I 

uplift a broad axe and split open his wormeaten skull 
1 1  1 blast out the ghastly contents of philosophically whited sepulchers and laugh with 

sardonic wrath 

HE BOOK OF LUCIFER 

THE ENLIGHTENMENT 

The Roman god Lucifer was the bearer of light the spirit of the air the personification of 
enlightenment In Christian mythology he became synonymous with evil which was only to 
have been expected from a religion whose very existence is perpetuated by clouded 
definitions and bogus values It is time to set the record straight False moralisms and occult 
inaccuracies must be corrected Entertaining as they might be most stories and plays about 
Devil worship must be recognized as the obsolete absurdities they are It has been said the 
truth will make men free The truth alone has never set anyone free It is only doubt which 
will bring mental emancipation Without the wonderful element of doubt the doorway 
through which truth passes would be tightiy shut impervious to the most strenuous poundings 
of a thousand Lucifers How understandable that Holy Scripture should refer to the Infernal 
monarch as the father of lies  a magnificent example of character inversion If one is to 
believe this theological accusation that the Devil represents falsehood then it surely must be 
concurred that it was he not god that established all spiritual religions and who wrote all of the 
holy bibles  When one doubt is followed by another the bubble grown large from long 
accumulated fallacies threatens to burst For those who already doubt supposed truths this 
book is revelation Then Lucifer will have risen Now is the time for doubt The bubble of 
falsehood is bursting and its sound is the roar of the world 

WANTED 

GOD 
DEAD OR ALIVE 

It is a popular misconception that the Satanist does not believe in God The concept of 

fGod as interpreted by man has been so varied throughout the ages that the Satanist 
simply accepts the definition which suits him best Man has always created his gods 
rather than his gods creating him God is to some benign  to others terrifying To the 
Satanist God  by whatever name he is called or by no name at all  is seen as the 
balancing factor in nature and not as being concerned with suffering This powerful 
force which permeates and balances the universe is far too impersonal to care about the 
happiness or misery of flesh andblood creatures on this ball of dirt upon which we 

live 

Anyone who tliinks of Satan as evil should consider all the men women children and 
animals who have died because it was Gods will Certainly a person grieving the untimely 
loss of a loved one would much rather have their loved one with them than in Gods hands 
Instead they are unctuously consoled by their clergyman who says It was Gods will my 
dear or He is in Gods hands now my son Such phrases have been a convenient way for 
religionists to condone or excuse the mercilessness of God But if God is in complete control 
and as benign as he is supposed to be why does He allow these things to happen Too long 
have religionists been falling back on their bibles and rulebooks to prove or disprove justify 
condemn or interpret 

The Satanist realizes that man and the action and reaction of the universe is responsible for 
everything and doesnt mislead himself into thinking that someone cares No longer will we 
sit back and accept fate without doing anything about it just because it says so in Chapter 
such and such Psalm so and so  and thats that The Satanist knows that praying does 
absolutely no good  in fact it actually lessens the chance of success for the devoutly 
religious too often sit back complacently and pray for a situation which if they were to do 
something about it on their own could be accomplished much quicker 

The Satanist shuns terms such as hope and prayer as they are indicative of apprehension 
If we hope and pray for something to come about we will not act in a positive way which will 
make it happen The Satanist realizing that anything he gets is of his own doing takes 
command of the situation instead of praying to God for it to happen Positive minking and 
positive action add up to results 

Just as the Satanist does not pray to God for assistance he does not pray for forgiveness for 
his wrong doings In other religions when one commits a wrong he either prays to God for 
forgiveness or confesses to an intermediary and asks him to pray to God for forgiveness for 
his sins The Satanist knows that praying does no good confessing to another human being 
like himself accomplishes even less  and is furthermore degrading 

When a Satanist commits a wrong he realizes that it is natural to make a mistake  and if he is 
truly sorry about what he has done he will learn from it and take care not to do the same thing 
again If he is not honestiy sorry about what he has done and knows he will do the same thing 
over and over he has no business confessing and asking forgiveness in the first place But this 
is exactiy what happens People confess their sins so that they can clear their consciences  
and be free to go out and sin again usually the same sin 

and be free to go out and sin again usually the same sin 

There are many different interpretations of God in the usual sense of the word as there are 
types of people The images run from a belief in a god who is some vague sort of universal 
cosmic mind to an anthropomorphic deity with a long white beard and sandals who keeps 
track of every action of each individual 

Even within the confines of a given religion the personal interpretations of God differ greatiy 
Some religions actually go so far as to label anyone who belongs to a religious sect other than 
their own a heretic even though the overall doctrines and impressions of godliness are nearly 
the same For example The Catholics believe that the Protestants are doomed to Hell simply 
because they do not belong to the Catholic Church In the same way many splinter groups of 
the Christian faith such as the evangelical or revivalist churches believe that the Catholics 
are heathens who worship graven images Christ is depicted in the image that is most 
psychologically akin to the individual worshipping him and yet the Christians criticize 
heathens for the worship of graven images And the Jews have always been given the 
Devils name 

Even though the god in all of these religions is basically the same each regards the way 
chosen by the others as reprehensible and to top it all religionists actually pray for one 
another They have scorn for the brothers of the righthand path because their religions carry 
different labels and somehow this animosity must be released What better way than through 
prayer  What a simperingly polite way of saying I hate your guts is the thinly disguised 
device known as praying for your enemy Praying for ones own enemy is nothing more than 
bargainbasement anger and of a decidedly shoddy and inferior quality 

If there has been so much violent discrepancy as to the proper way in which to worship God 
how many different interpretations of God can there be  and who is right 

All devout white lighters are concerned with pleasing God so that they might have the 
Pearly Gates opened for them when they die Nevertheless if a man has not lived his life in 
accordance with the regulations of his faith he can at the last minute call a clergyman to his 
deathbed for a final absolution The priest or minister will then come running on the double 
to make everything right with God and see to it that his passport to the Heavenly Realm is 
in order The Yezidis a sect of Devil worshippers take a different viewpoint They believe 
that God is allpowerful but also all forgiving and so accordingly feel that it is the Devil 
whom they must please as he is the one who rules their lives while here on earth They 
believe so strongly that God will forgive all of their sins once they have been given the last 
rites that they feel no need to concern themselves with the opinion God may hold of them 
while they live 

With all of the contradictions in the Christian scriptures many people currently cannot 
rationally accept Christianity the way it has been practiced in the past Great numbers of 
people are beginning to doubt the existence of God in the established Christian sense of the 
word So they have taken to calling themselves Christian Atheists True the Christian Bible 
is a mass of contradictions but what could be more contradictory than the term Christian 
Atheist 

If prominent leaders of the Christian faith are rejecting the past interpretations of God how 
then can their followers be expected to adhere to previous religious tradition 

With all the debates about whether or not God is dead if he isnt he had better have medicare 

jSa religions of a spiritual nature are inventions of man He has created an entire 

system of gods with nothing more than his carnal brain Just because he has an ego 
Jm and cannot accept it he has to externalize it into some great spiritual device which he 
 calls God 

 God can do all the things man is forbidden to do  such as kill people perform miracles 
J to gratify his will control without any apparent responsibility etc If man needs such a 
god and recognizes that god then he is worshipping an entity that a human being 
invented Therefore he is worshipping by proxy the man that invented god Is it not more sensible to 
worship a god that he himself has created in accordance with his own emotional needs  one 
that best represents the very carnal and physical being that has the idea power to invent a god 
in the first place 

If man insists on externalizing his true self in the form of God then why fear his true self in 
fearing God  why praise his true self in praising God  why remain externalized from 

God IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN RITUAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IN HIS NAME 

Man needs ritual and dogma but no law states that an externalized god is necessary in order 
to engage in ritual and ceremony performed in a gods name Could it be that when he closes 
the gap between himself and his God he sees the demon of pride creeping forth  that very 
embodiment of Lucifer appearing in his midst He no longer can view himself in two parts 
the carnal and the spiritual but sees them merge as one and then to his abysmal horror 
discovers that they are only the carnal  and always were Then he either hates himself to death 
day by day  or rejoices that he is what he is 

If he hates himself he searches out new and more complex spiritual paths of enlightenment 
in hopes that he may split himself up again in his quest for stronger and more externalized 
gods to scourge his poor miserable shell If he accepts himself but recognizes that ritual and 
ceremony are the important devices that his invented religions have utilized to sustain his 
faith in a lie then it is the same form of ritual that will sustain his faith in the truth  the 
primitive pageantry that will give his awareness of his own majestic being added substance 

When all religious faith in lies has waned it is because man has become closer to himself and 
farther from God closer to the Devil If this is what the devil represents and a man lives 
his life in the devils fane with the sinews of Satan moving in his flesh then he either escapes 
from the cackhngs and carpings of the righteous or stands proudly in his secret places of the 
earth and manipulates the folly ridden masses through his own Satanic might until that day 
when he may come forth in splendor proclaiming i am a satanist bow down for i am the highest 

EMBODIMENT OF HUMAN LIFE 

THE GOD YOU SAVE 
MAY BE YOURSELF 

SOME EVIDENCE OF 
A NEW SATANIC AGE 

a The seven deadly sins of the Christian Church are greed pride envy anger 

gluttony lust and sloth Satanism advocates indulging in each of these sins as they 
W all lead to physical mental or emotional gratification 

9 A Satanist knows there is nothing wrong with being greedy as it only means that he 
 wants more than he already has Envy means to look with favor upon the possessions 
J of others and to be desirous of obtaining similar things for oneself Envy and greed are 
the motivating forces of ambition  and without ambition very lMe of any importance 
would be accomplished 

Gluttony is simply eating more than you need to keep yourself alive When you have 
overeaten to the point of obesity another sin  pride  will motivate you to regain an 
appearance that will renew your selfrespect 

Anyone who buys an article of clothing for a purpose other than covering his body and 
protecting it from the elements is guilty of pride Satanists often encounter scoffers who 
maintain that labels are not necessary It must be pointed out to these destroyers of labels that 
one or many articles they themselves are wearing are not wearing are not necessary to keep 
them warm There is not a person on this earth who is completely devoid of ornamentation 
The Satanist points out that any ornamentation of the scoffers body shows that he too is 
guilty of pride Regardless of how verbose the cynic may be in his intellectual description of 
how free he is he is still wearing the elements of pride 

Being reluctant to get up in the morning is to be guilty of sloth and if you he in bed long 
enough you may find yourself committing yet another sin  lust To have the faintest stirring of 
sexual desire is to be guilty of lust In order to insure the propagation of humanity nature 
made lust the second most powerful instinct the first being selfpreservation Realizing this 
the Christian Church made fornication the Original Sin In this way they made sure no one 
would escape sin Your very state of being is as a result of sin  the Original sin 

The strongest instinct in every living thing is selfpreservation which brings us to the last of 
the seven deadly sins  anger Is it not our instinct for selfpreservation that is aroused when 
someone harms us when we become angry enough to protect ourselves from further attack 
A Satanist practices the motto If a man smite thee on one cheek smash him on the other 
Let no wrong go unredressed Be as a lion in the path  be dangerous even in defeat 

Since mans natural instincts lead him to sin all men are sinners and all sinners go to hell If 
everyone goes to hell then you will meet all your friends there Heaven must be populated 
with some rather strange creatures if they all lived for was to go to a place where they can 
strum harps for eternity 

Times have changed Religious leaders no longer preach that all our natural actions are 
sinful We no longer think sex is dirty  or that taking pride in ourselves is shameful  or that 
wanting something someone else has is vicious Of course not times have changed If you 
want proof of this just look at how liberal churches have become Why theyre practicing all 
the things that you preach 

Satanists hear these and similar statements all the time and they agree wholeheartedly but 
if the world has changed so much why continue to grasp at the threads of a dying faith If 
many religions are denying their own scriptures because they are out of date and are 
preaching the philosophies of Satanism why not call it by its rightful name  Satanism 
Certainly it would be far less hypocritical 

In recent years there has been an attempt to humanize the spiritual concept of Christianity 
This has manifested itself in the most obvious non spiritual means Masses which had been 
said in Latin are now said in native languages  which only succeeds in making the nonsense 
easier to understand and at the same time robs the ceremony of the esoteric nature which is 
consistent with the tenets of the dogma It is much simpler to obtain an emotional reaction 
using words and phrases that cannot be understood than it is with statements which even the 
simplest mind will question when hearing them in an understandable language 

If priests and ministers were to have used the devices to fill their churches one hundred years 
ago that they use today they would have been charged with heresy called devils ofttimes 
persecuted but certainly excommunicated without hesitation 

The religionists wail We must keep up with the times forgetting that due to limiting 
factors and deeply engrained laws of white light religions there can never be sufficient 
change to meet the needs of man 

Past religions have always represented the spiritual nature of man with little or no concern for 
his carnal or mundane needs They have considered this life but transitory and the flesh 
merely a shell physical pleasure trivial and pain a worthwhile preparation for the Kingdom 
of God How well the utter hypocrisy comes forth when the righteous make a change in 
their religion to keep up with mans natural change The only way that Christianity can ever 
completely serve the needs of man is to become as Satanism is now 

It has become necessary for a new religion based on mans natural instincts to come forth 
they have named it It is called Satanism It is that power condemned that has caused the 
religious controversy over birthcontrol measures  a disgruntled admission that sexual 
activity for fun is here to stay 

It is the Devil who caused women to show their legs to titillate men  the same kind of legs 
now socially acceptable to gaze upon which are revealed by young nuns as they walk about 
in their shortened habits What a delightful step in the right or left direction Is it possible 
we will soon see topless nuns sensually throwing their bodies about to the Missa Solemnis 
Rock Satan smiles and says he would like that fine  many nuns are very pretty girls with 
nice legs 

Many churches with some of the largest congregations have the most hand clapping sensual 
music  also Satanically inspired After all the Devil has always had the best tunes 

Church picnics despite all of Aunt Marthas talk about the Lords Bountiful Harvest are 
nothing more than a good excuse for Sunday gluttony and everyone knows that lots more 
than Bible reading goes on in the bushes 

The fundraising adjunct to many church bazaars is commonly known as a carnival which 
used to mean the celebration of the flesh now a carnival is okay because the money goes to 
the church so that it can preach against the temptations of the Devil It will be said that these 

things are only pagan devices and ceremonies  that the Christians borrowed them True but 
the Pagans reveled in the delights of the flesh and were condemned by the very same people 
who celebrate their rituals but call them by different names 

Priests and ministers are in the front lines of peace demonstrations and lying on railroad 
tracks in front of trains carrying war materials with as much dedication as their brothers of 
the cloth from the same seminaries who are blessing the bullets and bombs and fighting men 
as chaplains in the armed forces Someone must be wrong someplace Could it be that Satan 
is the one qualified to act as accuser Certainly they named him that 

When a puppy reaches maturity it becomes a dog when ice melts it is called water when 
twelve months have been used up we get a new calendar with the proper chronological name 
when magic becomes scientific fact we refer to it as medicine astronomy etc When one 
name is no longer appropriate for a given thing it is only logical to change it to a new one 
which better fits the subject Why then do we not follow suit in the area of religion Why 
continue to call a religion the same name when the tenets of that religion no longer fit the 
original one Or if religion does preach the same things that it always has but its followers 
practice nearly none of its teachings why do they continue to call themselves by the name 
given to followers of that religion 

If you do not believe in what your religion teaches why continue to support a belief which is 
contradictory with your feelings You would never vote for a person or issue you did not 
believe in so why cast your ecclesiastical vote for a religion which is not consistent with your 
convictions You have no right to complain about a political situation you have voted for or 
supported in any way  which includes sitting back and complacently agreeing with neighbors 
who approve the situation just because you are too lazy or cowardly to speak your mind So it 
is with religious balloting Even if you cannot be aggressively honest about your opinions 
because of unfavorable consequences from employers community leaders etc you can at 
least be honest with yourself In the privacy of your own home and with close friends you 
must support religion which has your best interests at heart 

Satanism is based on a very sound philosophy say the emancipated But why call it 
Satanism Why not call it something like Humanism or a name that would have the 
connotation of a witchcraft group something a little more esoteric  something less blatant 
There is more than one reason for this Humanism is not a religion It is simply a way of life 
with no ceremony or dogma Satanism has both ceremony and dogma Dogma as will be 
explained is necessary 

Satanism differs greatly from all other socalled white light white witchcraft or magical 
groups in the world today These selfrighteous and supercilious religions protest that their 
members use the powers of magic only for altruistic purposes Satanists look with disdain 
upon white witchcraft groups because they feel that altruism is sinning on the lay away 
plan It is unnatural not to have desire to gain things for yourself Satanism represents a form 
of controlled selfishness This does not mean that you never do anything for anyone else If 
you do something to make someone for whom you care happy his happiness will give you a 
sense of gratification 

Satanism advocates practicing a modified form of the Golden Rule Our interpretation of this 
rule is Do unto others as they do unto you because if you Do unto others as you would 
have them do unto you and they in turn treat you badly it goes against human nature to 
continue to treat them with consideration You should do unto others as you would have them 

do unto you but if your courtesy is not returned they should be treated with the wrath they 
deserve 

White witchcraft groups say that if you curse a person it will return to you three fold come 
home to roost or in some way boomerang back to the sender This is yet another indication of 
the guilt ridden philosophy which is held by these neo Pagan pseudo Christian groups White 
witches want to delve into witchcraft but cannot divorce themselves from the stigma attached 
to it Therefore they call themselves white magicians and base seventy five per cent of their 
philosophy on the trite and hackneyed tenets of Christianity Anyone who pretends to be 
interested in magic or the occult for reasons other that gaining personal power is the worst 
kind of hypocrite The Satanist respects Christianity for at least being consistent in its guilt 
ridden philosophy but can only feel contempt for the people who attempt to appear 
emancipated from guilt by joining a witchcraft group and then practice the same basic 
philosophy as Christianity 

White magic is supposedly utilized only for good or unselfish purposes and black magic we 
are told is used only for selfish or evil reasons Satanism draws no such dividing line 
Magic is magic be it used to help or hinder The Satanist being the magician should have the 
ability to decide what is just and then apply the powers of magic to attain his goals 

During white magical ceremonies the practitioners stand within a pentagram to protect 
themselves from the evil forces which they call upon for help To the Satanist it seems a bit 
twofaced to call on these forces for help while at the same time protecting yourself from the 
very powers you have asked for assistance The Satanist realizes that only by putting himself 
in league with these forces can be fully and unhypocritically utilize the Powers of Darkness to 
his best advantage 

In a Satanic magical ceremony the participants do not join hands and dance ring around the 
rosy in a circle bum candles of various colors for various wishes call out the names of 
Father Son and Holy Ghost while supposedly practicing Black Arts pick a Saint for their 
personal guide in obtaining help for their problems dunk themselves in smelly oils and hope 
the money comes in meditate so they can arrive at a great spiritual awakening recite long 
incantations with the name of Jesus thrown in for good measure between every few words 
etc etc etc ad nauseam 

because  This is not the way to practice Satanic magic If you cannot divorce yourself from 
hypocritical selfdeceit you will never be successful as a magician much less a Satanist 

The Satanic religion has not merely lifted the coin  it has flipped it completely over 
Therefore why should it support the very principles to which it is completely opposed by 
calling itself anything other than a name which is totally in keeping with the reversed 
doctrines which make up the Satanic philosophy Satanism is not a white light religion it is a 
religion of the flesh the mundane the carnal  all of which are ruled by Satan the 
personification of the Left Hand Path 

Inevitably the next question asked is Granted you cant call it humanism because 
humanism is not a religion but why even have a religion in the first place if all you do is what 
comes naturally anyway Why not just do it 

Modern man has come a long way he has become disenchanted with the nonsensical dogmas 
of past religions We are living in an enlightened age Psychiatry has made great strides in 

enlightening man about his true personality We are living in an era of intellectual awareness 
unlike any the world has ever seen 

This is all very well and good but  there is one flaw in this new state of awareness It is one 
thing to accept something intellectually but to accept the same thing emotionally is an 
entirely different matter The one need that psychiatry cannot fill is mans inherent need for 
emotionalizing through dogma Man needs ceremony and ritual fantasy and enchantment 
Psychiatry despite all the good it has done has robbed man of wonder and fantasy which 
religion in the past has provided 

Satanism realizing the current needs of man fills the large grey void between religion and 
psychiatry The Satanic philosophy combines the fundamentals of psychology and good 
honest emotionalizing or dogma It provides man with his much needed fantasy There is 
nothing wrong with dogma providing it is not based on ideas and actions which go 
completely against human nature 

The quickest way of traveling between two points is in a straight line If all the guilts that 
have been built up can be turned into advantages it ehrninates the need for intellectual 
purging of the psyche in an attempt to cleanse it from these repressions Satanism is the only 
religion known to man that accepts man as he is and promotes the rationale of turning a bad 
thing into a good thing rather than bending over backwards to eliminate the bad thing 

Therefore after intellectually evaluating your problems through common sense and drawing 
on what psychiatry has taught us if you still cannot emotionally release yourself from 
unwarranted guilt and put your theories into action then you should learn to make your guilt 
work for you You should act upon your natural instincts and then if you cannot perform 
without feeling guilty revel in your guilt This may sound like a contradiction in terms but if 
you will think about it guilt can often add a fillip to the senses Adults would do well to take 
a lesson from children Children often take great delight in doing something they know they 
are not supposed to 

Yes times have changed but man hasnt The basics of Satanism have always existed The 
only thing that is new is the formal organization of a religion based on the universal traits of 
man For centuries magnificent structures of stone concrete mortar and steel have been 
devoted to mans abstinence It is high time that human beings stopped fighting themselves 
and devoted their time to building temples designed for mans indulgences 

Even though times have changed and always will man remains basically the same For two 
thousand years man has done penance for something he never should have had to feel guilty 
about in the first place We are tired of denying ourselves the pleasures of life which we 
deserve Today as always man needs to enjoy himself here and now instead of waiting for 
his rewards in heaven So why not have a religion based on indulgence Certainly it is 
consistent with the nature of the beast We are no longer supplicating weaklings trembling 
before an unmerciful God who cares not whether we live or die We are selfrespecting 
prideful people  we are Satanists 

HELL THE DEVIL 

AND HOW TO 
SELL YOUR SOUL 

Satan has certainly been the best friend the church has ever had as he has kept it in 

business all these years The false doctrine of Hell and the Devil has allowed the 
Protestant and Catholic Churches to flourish far too long Without a devil to point their 
fingers at rehgionists of the right hand path would have nothing with which to threaten 
their followers Satan leads you to temptation Satan is the prince of evil Satan is 
vicious cruel brutal they warn If you give in to the temptations of the devil you 
will surely suffer eternal damnation and roast in Hell 

The semantic meaning of Satan is the adversary or opposition or the accuser The very 
word devil comes from the Indian devi which means god Satan represents opposition to 
all religions which serve to frustrate and condemn man for his natural instincts He has been 
given an evil role simply because he represents the carnal earthly and mundane aspects of 
life 

Satan the chief devil of the Western World was originally an angel whose duty was to report 
human delinquencies to God It was not until the Fourteenth Century that he began to be 
depicted as an evil deity who was part man and part animal with goat like horns and hooves 
Before Christianity gave him the names of Satan Lucifer etc the carnal side of mans nature 
was governed by the god which was then called Dionysus or Pan depicted as a satyr or faun 
by the Greeks Pan was originally the good guy and symbolized fertility and fecundity 

Whenever a nation comes under a new form of government the heroes of the past become 
villains of the present So it is with religion The earliest Christians believed that the Pagan 
deities were devils and to employ them was to use black magic Miraculous heavenly 
events they termed white magic this was the sole distinction between the two The old gods 
did not die they fell into Hell and became devils The bogey goblin or bugaboo used to 
frighten children is derived from the Slavonic Bog which means god as does Bhaga in 
Hindu 

Many pleasures revered before the advent of Christianity were condemned by the new 
religion It required little changeover to transform the horns and cloven hooves of Pan into a 
most convincing devil Pans attributes could be neatiy changed into charged with punishment 
sins and so the metamorphosis was complete 

The association of the goat with the Devil is found in the Christian Bible where the holiest 
day of the year the Day of Atonement was celebrated by casting lots for two goats without 
blemish one to be offered to the Lord and one to Azazel The goat carrying the sins of the 
people was driven into the desert and became a scapegoat This is the origin of the goat 
which is still used in lodge ceremonies today as it was also used in Egypt where once a year 
it was sacrificed to a God 

The devils of mankind are many and their origins diversified The performance of Satanic 
ritual does not embrace the calling forth of demons this practice is followed only by those 
who are in fear of the very forces they conjure 

Supposedly demons are malevolent spirits with attributes conductive to the deterioration of 
the people or events that they touch upon The Greek word demon meant a guardian spirit or 
source of inspiration and to be sure later theologians invented legion upon legion of these 
harbingers of inspiration  all wicked 

An indication of the cowardice of magicians of the righthand path is the practice of calling 
upon a particular demon who would supposedly be a minion of the devil to do his bidding 
The assumption is that the demon being only a flunky of the devil is easier to control Occult 
lore states that only the most formidably protected or insanely foolhardy sorcerer would try 
to call forth the Devil himself 

The Satanist does not furtively call upon these lesser devils but brazenly invokes those who 
people that infernal army of longstanding outrage  the Devils themselves 

Theologians have catalogued some of the names of devils in their lists of demons as might be 
expected but the roster which follows contains the names and origins of the Gods and 
Goddesses called upon which make up a large part of the occupancy of the Royal Palace of 
Hell 

FIRE 

THE BOOK OF SATAN 

THE INFERNAL DIATRIBE 

The first book of the Satanic Bible is not an attempt to blaspheme as much as it is a statement 
of what might be termed diabolical indignation The Devil has been attacked by the men of 
God relentlessly and without reservation Never has there been an opportunity short of 
fiction for the Dark Prince to speak out in the same manner as the spokesmen of the Lord of 
the Righteous The pulpit pounders of the past have been free to define good and evil as 
they see fit and have gladly smashed into oblivion any who disagree with their lies  both 
verbally and at times physically Their talk of charity when applied to His Infernal 
Majesty becomes an empty sham  and most unfairly too considering the obvious fact that 
without their Satanic foe their very religions would collapse How sad that the allegorical 
personage most responsible for the success of spiritual religions is shown the least amount of 
charity and the most consistent abuse  and by those who most unctuously preach the rules of 
fair play For all the centuries of shouting down the Devil has received he has never shouted 
back at his detractors He has remained the gentleman at all times while those he supports 
rant and rave He has shown himself to be a model of deportment but now he feels it is time 
to shout back He has decided it is finally time to receive his due Now the ponderous rule 
books of hypocrisy are no longer needed In order to relearn the Law of the Jungle a small 
slim diatribe will do Each verse is an inferno Each word is a tongue of fire The flames of 
Hell bum fierce    and purify Read on and learn the Law 

LOVE AND HATE 

Satanism represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on 
ingrates 

You cannot love everyone it is ridiculous to think you can If you love everyone and 
everything you lose your natural powers of selection and wind up being a pretty poor 
judge of character and quality If anything is used too freely it loses its true meaning 
Therefore the Satanist believes you should love strongly and completely those who 
deserve your love but never turn the other cheek to your enemy 

Love is one of the most intense emotions felt by man another is hate Forcing yourself to feel 
indiscriminate love is very unnatural If you try to love everyone you only lessen your 
feelings for those who deserve your love Repressed hatred can lead to many physical and 
emotional ailments By learning to release your hatred towards those who deserve it you 
cleanse yourself of these malignant emotions and need not take your pentup hatred out on 
your loved ones 

There has never been a great love movement in the history of the world that hasnt wound 
up killing countless numbers of people we must assume to prove how much they loved 
them Every hypocrite who ever walked the earth has had pockets bulging with love 

Every pharisaical rehgionist claims to love his enemies even though when wronged he 
consoles himself by tMnking God will punish them Instead of admitting to themselves that 
they are capable of hating their foes and treating them in the manner they deserve they say 
There but for the grace of God go I and pray for them Why should we humiliate and 
lower ourselves by drawing such inaccurate comparisons 

Satanism has been thought of as being synonymous with cruelty and brutality This is so only 
because people are afraid to face the truth  and the truth is that human beings are not all 
benign or all loving Just because the Satanist admits he is capable of both love and hate he is 
considered hateful On the contrary because he is able to give vent to his hatred through 
ritualized expression he is far more capable of love  the deepest kind of love By honestiy 
recognizing and admitting to both the hate and the love he feels there is no confusing one 
emotion with the other Without being able to experience one of these emotions you cannot 
fully experience the other 

SATANIC SEX 

TVIuch controversy has arisen over the Satanic views on free love It is often 

assumed that sexual activity is the most important factor of the Satanic religion and 
that willingness to participate in sex orgies is a prerequisite for becoming a Satanist 
Nothing could be farther from the truth In fact opportunists who have no deeper 
interest in Satanism than merely the sexual aspects are emphatically discouraged 

Satanism does advocate sexual freedom but only in the true sense of the word Free 
love in the Satanic concept means exactly that  freedom to either be faithful to one 
person or to indulge your sexual desires with as many others as you feel is necessary to satisfy 
your particular needs 

Satanism does not encourage orgiastic activity or extramarital affairs for those to whom they 
do not come naturally For many it would be very unnatural and detrimental to be unfaithful 
to their chosen mates To others it would be frustrating to be bound sexually to just one 
person Each person must decide for himself what form of sexual activity best suits his 
individual needs Self deceitfully forcing yourself to be adulterous or to have sex partners 
when not married just for the sake of proving others or worse yet to yourself that you are 
emancipated from sexual guilt is just as wrong by Satanic standards as leaving any sexual 
need unfulfilled because of ingrained feelings of guilt 

Many of those who are constantly preoccupied with demonstrating their emancipation from 
sexual guilt are in reality held in even greater sexual bondage than those who simply accept 
sexual activity as a natural part of life and dont make a big todo over their sexual freedom 
For example it is an established fact that the nymphomaniac every mans dream girl and 
heroine of all lurid novels is not sexually free but is actually frigid and roves from man to 
man because she is too inhibited to ever find complete sexual release 

Another misconception is the idea that ability to engage in group sexual activity is the 
indicative of sexual freedom All contemporary free sex groups have one thing in common  
discouragement of fetishistic or deviant activity 

Actually the most forced examples of non fetishistic sexual activity thinly disguised as 
freedom have a common format Each of the participants in an orgy removes all clothing 
following the example set forth by one and mechanically fornicate  also following the 
leaders example None of the performers consider that their emancipated form of sex might 
be regarded as regimented and infantile by non members who fail to equate uniformity with 
freedom 

The Satanist realizes that if he is to be a sexual connoisseur and truly free from all sexual 
guilt he cannot be stifled by the socalled sexual revolutionists any more than he can by the 
prudery of his guilt ridden society These free sex clubs miss the whole point of sexual 
freedom Unless sexual activity can be expressed on an individual basis which includes 
personal fetishes there is absolutely no purpose in belonging to a sexual freedom 
organization 

Satanism condones any type of sexual activity which properly satisfies your individual desires 
be it heterosexual homosexual bisexual or even asexual if you choose Satanism also 
sanctions any fetish or deviation which will enhance your sex life so long as it involves no 
one who does not wish to be involved 

The prevalence of deviant andor fetishistic behavior in our society would stagger the 
imagination of the sexually naive There are more sexual variants than the unenlightened 
individual can perceive transvestism sadism masochism urolagnia exhibitionism  to name 
only a few of the more predominant Everyone has some form of fetish but because they are 
unaware of the preponderance of fetishistic activity in our society they feel they are depraved 
if they submit to their unnatural yearnings 

Even the asexual has a deviation  his asexuality It is far more abnormal to have a lack of 
sexual desire unless illness or oldage or another valid reason has caused the wane than it is 
to be sexually promiscuous However if a Satanist chooses sexual sublimination above overt 
sexual expression that is entirely his own affair In many cases of sexual sublimination or 
asexuality any attempt to emancipate himself sexually would prove devastating to the 
asexual 

Asexuals are invariably sexually sublimated by their jobs or hobbies All the energy and 
driving interest which would normally be devoted to sexual activity is channeled into other 
pastimes or into their chosen occupations If a person favors other interests over sexual 
activity it is his right and no one is justified in condemning him for it However the person 
should at least recognize the fact that this is a sexual sublimation 

Because of lack of opportunity for expression many secret sexual desires never progress 
beyond the fantasy stage Lack of release often leads to compulsion and therefore a great 
number of people devise undetectable methods of giving vent to their urges Just because 
most fetishistic activity is not outwardly apparent the sexually unsophisticated should not 
delude himself into tliinking it does not exist To cite examples of the ingenious techniques 
used The male transvestite will indulge in his fetish by wearing feminine undergarments 
while going about his daily activities or the masochistic woman might wear a rubber girdle 
several sizes too small so she may derive sexual pleasure from her fetishistic discomfort 
throughout the day with no one the wiser These illustrations are far tamer and more 
prevalent examples than others which could have been given 

Satanism encourages any form of sexual expression you may desire so long as it hurts no one 
else This statement must be qualified to avoid misinterpretation By not hurting another this 
does not include the unintentional hurt felt by those who might not agree with your views on 
sex because of their anxieties regarding sexual morality Naturally you should avoid 
offending others who mean a great deal to you such as prudish friends and relatives 
However if you earnestly endeavor to escape hurting them and despite your efforts they 
accidentally find out you cannot be held responsible and therefore should feel no guilt as a 
result of either your sexual convictions or their being hurt because of those convictions If 
you are in constant fear of offending the prudish by your attitude towards sex then there is no 
sense in trying to emancipate yourself from sexual guilt However no purpose is served by 
flaunting your permissiveness 

The other exception to the rule regards dealings with masochists A masochist derives 
pleasure from being hurt so denying the masochist his pleasure through pain hurts him just as 
much as actual physical pain hurts the non masochist The story of the truly cruel sadist 
illustrates this point The masochist says to the sadist beat me To which the merciless 
sadist replies ko If a person wants to be hurt and enjoys suffering then there is no reason 

not to indulge him in his wont 

The term sadist in popular usage describes one who obtains pleasure from indiscriminate 
brutality Actually though a true sadist is selective He carefully chooses from the vast 
reserve of appropriate victims and takes great delight in giving those who thrive on misery 
the fulfillment of their desires The welladjusted sadist is epicurean in selecting those on 
whom his energies will be well spent If a person is healthy enough to admit he is a masochist 
and enjoys being enslaved and whipped the real sadist is glad to oblige 

Aside from the foregoing exceptions the Satanist would not intentionally hurt others by 
violating their sexual rights If you attempt to impose your sexual desires upon others who do 
not welcome your advances you are Mringing upon their sexual freedom Therefore 
Satanism does not advocate rape child molesting sexual defilement of animals or any other 
form of sexual activity which entails the participation of those who are unwilling or whose 
innocence or naivete would allow them to be intimidated or misguided into doing something 
against their wishes 

If all parties involved are mature adults who willingly take full responsibility for their actions 
and voluntarily engage in a given form of sexual expression  even if it is generally 
considered taboo  then there is no reason for them to repress their sexual inclinations 

If you are aware of all the implications advantages and disadvantages and are certain your 
actions will hurt no one who does not wish or deserve to be hurt you have no cause to 
suppress your sexual preferences 

Just as no two people are exactly the same in their choice of diet or have the same capacity for 
the consumption of food sexual tastes and appetites vary from person to person No person or 
society has the right to set limitations on the sexual standards or the frequency of sexual 
activity of another Proper sexual conduct can only be judged within the context of each 
individual situation Therefore what one person considers sexually correct and moral may be 
frustrating to another The reverse is also true one person may have great sexual prowess but 
it is unjust for him to belittle another whose sexual capacity may not equal his own and 
inconsiderate for him to impose himself upon the other person ie the man who has a 
voracious sexual appetite but whose wifes sexual needs do not match his own It is unfair for 
him to expect her to enthusiastically respond to his overtures but she must display the same 
degree of thoughtfulness In the instances when she does not feel great passion she should 
either passively but pleasantly accept him sexually or raise no complaint if he chooses to 
find his needed release elsewhere  including auto erotic practices 

The ideal relationship is one in which the people are deeply in love with one another and are 
sexually compatible However perfect relationships are relatively uncommon It is important 
to point out here that spiritual love and sexual love can but do not necessarily go hand in 
hand If there is a certain amount of sexual compatibility often it is limited and some but not 
all of the sexual desires will be fulfilled 

There is no greater sexual pleasure than that derived from association with someone you 
deeply love if you are sexually well suited If you are not suited to one another sexually 
though it must be stressed that lack of sexual compatibility does not indicate lack of spiritual 
love One can and often does exist without the other As a matter of fact often one member 
of a couple will resort to outside sexual activity because he deeply loves his mate and wishes 
to avoid hurting or imposing upon his loved one Deep spiritual love is enriched by sexual 

love and it is certainly a necessary ingredient for any satisfactory relationship but because of 
differing sexual predilections outside sexual activity or masturbation sometimes provides a 
needed supplement 

Masturbation considered a sexual taboo by many people creates a guilt problem not easily 
dealt with Much emphasis must be placed on this subject as it constitutes an extremely 
important ingredient of many a successful magical working 

Ever since the Judaeo Christian Bible described the sin of Onan Gen 38710 man has 
considered the seriousness and consequences of the solitary vice Even though modem 
sexologists have explained the sin of Onan as simply coitus interruptus the damage has been 
done through centuries of theological misinterpretation 

Aside from actual sex crimes masturbation is one of the most frowned upon sexual acts 
During the last century innumerable texts were written describing the horrific consequences 
of masturbation Practically all physical or mental illnesses were attributed to the evils of 
masturbation Pallor of the complexion shortness of breath furtive expression sunken chest 
nervousness pimples and loss of appetite are only a few of the many characteristics 
supposedly resulting from masturbation total physical and mental collapse was assured if one 
did not heed the warnings in those handbooks for young men 

The lurid descriptions in such texts would be almost humorous were it not for the unhappy 
fact that even though contemporary sexologists doctors writers etc have done much to 
remove the stigma of masturbation the deepseated guilts induced by the nonsense in those 
sexual primers have been only partially erased A large percentage of people especially those 
over forty cannot emotionally accept the fact that masturbation is natural and healthy even if 
they now accept it intellectually and they in turn relate their repugnance often 
subconsciously to their children 

It was thought that one would go insane if despite numerous admonitions his auto erotic 
practices persisted This preposterous myth grew from reports of wide spread masturbation by 
the inmates of mental institutions It was assumed that since almost all incurably insane 
people masturbated it was their masturbation that had driven them mad No one ever stopped 
to consider the lack of sexual partners of the opposite sex and the freedom from inhibition 
which is a characteristic of extreme insanity were the real reasons for the masturbatory 
practices of the insane 

Many people would rather have their mates seek outside sexual activity than perform auto 
erotic acts because of their own guilt feelings the mates repugnance towards having them 
engage in masturbation or the fear of their mates repugnance  although in a surprising 
number of cases a vicarious thrill is obtained from the knowledge that the mate is having 
sexual experiences with outsiders  although this is seldom admitted 

If stimulation is provided by envisioning ones mate sexually engaged with others this should 
be brought out into the open where both parties may gain from such activities However if the 
prohibition of masturbation is only due to guilt feelings on the part of one or both parties they 
should make every attempt to erase those guilts  or utilize them Many relationships might be 
saved from destruction if the people involved did not feel guilt about performing the natural 
act of masturbation 

Masturbation is regarded as evil because it produces pleasure derived from intentionally 

fondling a forbidden area of the body by ones own hand The guilt feelings accompanying 
most sexual acts can be assuaged by the religiously acceptable contention that your sensual 
delights are necessary to produce off spring  even though you cautiously watch the calendar 
for the safe days You cannot however placate yourself with this rationale while engaging 
in masturbatory practices 

No matter what youve been told about the immaculate conception  even if blind faith 
allows you to swallow this absurdity  you know full well if you are to produce a child there 
must be sexual contact with a person of the opposite sex If you feel guilty for committing the 
original sin you certainly will feel even deeper guilt for performing a sex act only for self 
gratification with no intention of creating children 

The Satanist fully realizes why religionists declare masturbation to be sinful Like all other 
natural acts people will do it no matter how severely reprimanded Causing guilt is an 
important facet of their malicious scheme to obligate people to atone for sins by paying the 
mortgages on temples of abstinence 

Even if a person is no longer struggling under the burden of religiously induced guilt or 
thinks he isnt modem man still feels shame if he yields to his masturbatory desires A man 
may feel robbed of his masculinity if he satisfies himself autoerotically rather than engaging 
in the competitive game of woman chasing A woman may satisfy herself sexually but yearns 
for the ego gratification that comes from the sport of seduction Neither the quasi Casanova 
nor bogus vamp feels adequate when reduced to masturbation for sexual gratification both 
would prefer even an inadequate partner Satanically speaking though it is far better to 
engage in a perfect fantasy than to cooperate in an unrewarding experience with another 
person With masturbation you are in complete control of the situation 

To illustrate the undebatable fact that masturbation is an entirely normal and healthy practice 
it is performed by all members of the animal kingdom Human children will also follow their 
instinctive masturbatory desires unless they have been scolded for it by their indignant parents 
who were undoubtably berated for it by their parents and so on down the retrocedent line 

statnic sex is so cool!!!! statnic sex is so cool!!! statnic sex is so cool!!! statnic sex is so cool!!!im so edgy

It is unfortunate but true that the sexual guilts of parents will immutably be passed on to their 
children In order to save our children from the illfated sexual destiny of our parents 
grandparents and possibly ourselves the perverted moral code of the past must be exposed 
for what it is a pragmatically organized set of rules which if rigidly obeyed would destroy 
us Unless we emancipate ourselves from the ridiculous sexual standards of our present 
society including the socalled sexual revolution the neuroses caused by those stifling 
regulations will persist Adherence to the sensible and humanistic new morality of Satanism 
can  and will  evolve society in which our children can grow up healthy and without the 
devastating moral encumbrances of our existing sick society 

NOT ALL VAMPIRES 
SUCK BLOOD 

Satanism represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic 
vampires 

Many people who walk the earth practice the fine art of making others feel responsible 
and even indebted to them without cause Satanism observes these leeches in their true 
light Psychic vampires are individuals who drain others of their vital energy This type 
of person can be found in all avenues of society They fill no useful purpose in our 
lives and are neither love objects nor true friends Yet we feel responsible to the 
psychic vampire without knowing why 

If you think you may be the victim of such a person there are a few simple rules which will 
help you form a decision Is there a person you often call or visit even though you really dont 
want to because you know you will feel guilty if you dont Or do you find yourself 
constantiy doing favors for one who doesnt come forward and ask but hints Often the 
psychic vampire will use reverse psychology saying Oh I couldnt ask you to do that  and 
you in turn insist upon doing it The psychic vampire never demands anything of you That 
would be far too presumptuous They simply let their wishes be known in subtie ways which 
will prevent them from being considered pests They wouldnt think of imposing and are 
always content and willingly accept their lot without the slightest complaint  outwardly 

Their sins are not of commission but of omission Its what they don t say not what they do 
say that makes you feel you must account to them They are much too crafty to make overt 
demands upon you because they know you would resent it and would have a tangible and 
legitimate reason for denying them 

A large percentage of these people have special attributes which make their dependence 
upon you more feasible and much more effective Many psychic vampires are invalids or 
pretend to be or are mentally or emotionally disturbed Others might feign ignorance or 
incompetence so you will out of pity  or more often exasperation  do things for them 

The traditional way to banish a demon or elemental is to recognize it for what it is and 
exorcise it Recognition of these modem day demons and their methods is the only antidote 
for their devastating hold over you 

Most people accept these passively vicious individuals at face value only because their 
insidious maneuvers have never been pointed out to them They merely accept these poor 
souls as being less fortunate than themselves and feel they must help them however they 
can It is this misdirected sense of responsibility or unfounded sense of guilt which 
nourishes well the altruisms upon which these parasites feast 

The psychic vampire is allowed to exist because he cleverly chooses conscientious 
responsible people for his victims  people with great dedication to their moral obligations 

In some cases we are vampirized by groups of people as well as individuals Every fund 
raising organization be it a charitable foundation community council religious or fraternal 
association etc carefully selects a person who is adept at making others feel guilty for its 

chairman or coordinator It is the job of this chairman to intimidate us into opening first our 
hearts and then our wallets to the recipient of their good will  never mentioning that in 
many cases their time is not unselfishly donated but that they are drawing a fat salary for 
their noble deeds They are masters at playing upon the sympathy and consideration of 
responsible people How often we see little children who have been sent forth by these self 
righteous Fagins to painlessly extract donations from the kindly Who can resist the innocent 
charm of a child 

There are of course people who are not happy unless they are giving but many of us do not 
fit into this category Unfortunately we are often put upon to do things we do not genuinely 
feel should be required of us A conscientious person finds it very difficult to decide between 
voluntary and imposed charity He wants to do what is right and just and finds it perplexing 
trying to decide exactly who he should help and what degree of aid should rightfully be 
expected of him 

Each person must decide for himself what his obhgations are to his respective friends family 
and community Before donating his time and money to those outside his immediate family 
and close circle of friends he must decide what he can afford without depriving those closest 
to him When taking these things into consideration he must be certain to include himself 
among those who mean most to him He must carefully evaluate the validity of the request 
and the personality or motives of the person asking it of him 

It is extremely difficult for a person to learn to say no when all his life he has said yes 
But unless he wants to be constantly taken advantage of he must learn to say no when 
circumstances justify doing so If you allow them psychic vampires will gradually infiltrate 
your everyday life until you have no privacy left  and your constant feeling of concern for 
them will deplete you of all ambition 

A psychic vampire will always select a person who is relatively content and satisfied with his 
life  a person who is happily married pleased with his job and generally welladjusted to the 
world around him  to feed upon The very fact that the psychic vampire chooses to victimize 
a happy person shows that he is lacking all the things his victim has he will do everything he 
can to stir up trouble and disharmony between his victim and those people he holds dear 

Therefore be wary of anyone who seems to have no real friends and no apparant interest in 
life except you He will usually tell you he is very selective in his choice of friends or 
doesnt make friends easily because of the high standards he sets for his companions To 
acquire and keep friends one must be willing to give of himself  something of which the 
psychic vampire is incapable But he will hasten to add that you fulfill every requirement and 
are truly an outstanding exception among men  you are one of the very few worthy of his 
friendship 

Lest you confuse desperate love which is a very selfish thing with psychic vampirism the 
vast difference between the two must be clarified The only way to determine if you are being 
vampirized is to weigh what you give the person compared to what they give you in return 

You may at times become annoyed with the obhgations put upon you by a loved one a close 
friend or even an employer But before you label them psychic vampires you must ask 
yourself What am I getting in return If your spouse or lover insists that you call them 
frequentiy but you also require them to account to you for their time spent away from you 
you must realize this is a give and take situation Or if a friend is in the habit of calling upon 

you for help at inopportune moments but you similarly depend upon them to give your 
immediate needs priority you must regard it as a fair exchange If your employer asks you to 
do a little more than is normally expected of you in your particular position but will overlook 
occasional tardiness or will give you time off when you need it you certainly have no cause 
for complaint and need not feel he is taking advantage of you 

You are however being vampirized if you are incessantly called upon or expected to do 
favors for someone who when you need a favor always happens to have other pressing 
obligations 

Being purely Satanic the only way to deal with a psychic vampire is to play dumb and act 
as though they are genuinely altruistic and really expect nothing in return Teach them a 
lesson by graciously taking what they give you thanking them loudly enough for all to hear 
and walking away In this way you come out the victor What can they say And when you 
are inevitably expected to repay their generosity this is the hard part you say no  but 
again graciously When they feel you falling from their clutches two things will happen 
First they will act crushed hoping your old feeling of duty and sympathy will return and 
when and if it doesnt they will show their true colors and will become angry and 
vindictive 

Once you have moved them to this point you can play the role of the injured party After all 
youve done nothing wrong  you just happened to have had pressing obligations when they 
needed you and since nothing was expected in return for their gifts there should be no hard 
feelings 

Generally the psychic vampire will realize his methods have been discovered and will not 
press the issue He will not continue to waste his time with you but will move on to his next 
unsuspecting victim 

There are times however when the psychic vampire will not release his hold so easily and 
will do everything possible to torment you They have plenty of time for this because when 
once rejected they will neglect all else what little else they have that is to devote their every 
waking moment to planning the revenge to which they feel they are entitled For this reason it 
is best to avoid a relationship with this kind of person in the first place Their adulation and 
dependence upon you may at first be very flattering and their material gifts very attractive 
but you will eventually find yourself paying for them many times over 

Dont waste your time with people who will ultimately destroy you but concentrate instead on 
those who will appreciate your responsibility to them and likewise feel responsible to you 

And if you are a psychic vampire  take heed Beware of the Satanist  he is ready and willing 
to gleefully drive the proverbial stake through your heart
